WELCOME TO THE COFFEE GAME!!!



## FOR USE ##

FORK (OR CLONE) THE REPO

RUN 'npm install' TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

'npm start' TO BOOT UP ON LOCALHOST:1234



## PLAY THE GAME ##


## BUGS THAT COULD BE FIXED ##

- SERVICE WORKER ON LOCALHOST MAKES IMAGES DISAPPEAR FOR A SPLIT SECOND AFTER YOU LOSE FOR SOME REASON

- I FIGURED OUT HOW TO PAUSE THE TIMER AND PAUSE THE CUPS SEPERATELY, BUT COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMBINE THEM INTO ONE BUTTON, SO ONLY THE TIMER PAUSES

- RETRY WORKS MOST OF THE TIME, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT STARTS THE GAME WITH THE CUP ALREADY FULL


## RANDOM NOTES ##

- CUPS FILL FASTER AND FASTER, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A FASTER SPEED FOR LESS CUPS AND A SLOWER SPEED FOR MORE CUPS
